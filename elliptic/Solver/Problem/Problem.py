class ProblemBase(object):
    """Defines a type of problem. A problem can expose many set-up methods
    or optional steps associated with solving the given kind of problem. A
    Runner should be associated with the finite steps of interest.

    A problem should be loosely coupled with the Pipeline class, in the sense
    that it must not depend on what kernels are present on the pipeline.

    A problem might need to be tightly coupled with the MatrixManager class, or
    with the Trilinos library.

    pipeline: elliptic.Problem.Pipeline.Pipeline
        Pipeline to be used in this problem.
    solution_dim: unsigned int
        Dimension of the target solution.
