# Running

To run this problem with a preprocessed mesh, use the command `python Problem02.py`. The `Problem02.py` file is configured to search for the preprocessed mesh file under the `Meshes` folder.


# Results

The results are exported as VTK files to the `Output` folder by default. Notice that this folder must be created before running the simulation.
